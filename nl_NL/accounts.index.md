There's something weird with expense accounts. Even though you pay into expense accounts, they tend to have a positive saldo. Likewise, revenue accounts have a negative balance. At first glance this should be reversed. But remember that when you pay McDonalds, they *earn* money. Likewise, when your employer pays you, they *lose* money. For you personally it's the exact opposite but this list is from their perspective. A store makes money off you, an employer loses money to you.

There are three types of accounts.

**Betaalrekeningen**

Accounts that hold your money: your bank accounts.

**Crediteuren**

These represent the people you pay. Shops are likely.

**Debiteuren**

These represent the people that pay you. Your job for example.
