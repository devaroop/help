What happens when you edit a goal should be fairly obvious. If you change the amount to below the amount currently saved, the goal will be updated to reflect this. 

Let's assume you have a goal with a target amount of 500,- and it contains 300,-. If you change the target amount to 200,-, the amount in the goal will also drop to 200,-.
