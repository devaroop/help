Almost everybody has regular expenses that come back every month, quarter or year. In PaisaWorks, you can register such expenses as "bills".

When you create bills, PaisaWorks will report on the expected amount of bills for each period of time. PaisaWorks uses rules to match transactions to bills. This way you can match your expenses to the bills you have (yet) to pay.
 
In short, you can create a bill for "rent" or for "insurance" and every month, PaisaWorks will show you if you paid for it.

If you want to read more about bills, check out the [official documentation on bills](https://firefly-iii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/bills.html).
