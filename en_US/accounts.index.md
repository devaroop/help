This page shows the accounts you have. It lists the current balance and the latest date of activity.

There's something weird with expense accounts. Even though you pay into expense accounts, they tend to have a positive balance. Likewise, revenue accounts have a negative balance. At first glance this should be reversed. But remember that when you pay McDonalds, they *earn* money. Likewise, when your employer pays you, they *lose* money. For you personally it's the exact opposite but this list is from their perspective. A store makes money off you, an employer loses money to you.

There are three types of accounts.

**Asset accounts**

Asset accounts are your personal bank accounts, fixed deposits, Securities and shares, Cash, etc


**Expense accounts**

Expense accounts are the accounts you spend money at, such as stores and friends. eg. Netflix, PVR, Electricity Bill, Grocery Store, Land lord, etc

**Revenue accounts**

Revenue accounts are accounts you receive money from, such as your job, the government or other sources of income. eg. Rental Income, Online Advertising, Job, etc

**Liabilities**

Liabilities are your debts and loans such as old credit card debts, eduction loans, home loans, car loans etc.
