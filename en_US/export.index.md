The export page allows you to export basic information about your transactions so you can import it in another system later. You can choose to export the original, unencrypted uploads and old files you imported in the past.

The export will contain all basic fields and amounts, some meta-information and currency data.

Remember that such an export is NOT enough to restore your PaisaWorks installation! The data exported does not include budgeted amounts, links to bills or other metadata. If you wish to make a backup, please just export the database and your attachments.

If you want to read more about exporting data, check out the [official documentation on exporting data](https://firefly-iii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/import/export.html).
