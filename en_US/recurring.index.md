This shows you all recurring transactions.

Recurring transactions can be used to make Firefly III automatically create transactions for you. In order for it to work, you must have a cron job running that creates these transactions for you.

Read more about recurring transactions in [the official documentation](https://firefly-iii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/recurring.html).
